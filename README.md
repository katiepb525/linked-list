# linked-list

Definition of a linked list:

A linear collection of data elements 
without a reliance on physical placement in memory 
for their order.

Linked lists are similar to arrays, except that they dont require reallocation as they are not position dependent and items can be easily removed or inserted.

Each element points to the next, similar to a queue data structure.
Each node contains a bit of data, and a 
reference to the next node in the sequence.
